# Releasing

The `Release` workflow publishes only when a maintainer pushes a `v*` tag. The tag
must equal the `modn-cli` version, for example `v0.1.0`. The workflow builds
`modn.exe` on Windows and smoke-tests it on a second, clean runner. The smoke
test runs from an empty directory, with no repository and no `cargo` or `rustc`
on `PATH`. It checks the checksum, the absence of C runtime DLL imports,
`search`, `install --dry-run` for a catalog mod and for a local archive, and
`doctor` on a fake game. It also checks that the fake game's files and their
contents are unchanged. Only
then does the workflow publish the GitHub release. A version with a pre-release
suffix, such as `0.2.0-alpha.1`, becomes a GitHub pre-release. Pull requests
that change the workflow or the smoke script run the build and smoke jobs, but
they never publish.

Run the same smoke test locally on a built executable:

```powershell
$env:RUSTFLAGS = '-C target-feature=+crt-static'
cargo build --release --locked -p modn-cli
pwsh -File .github/scripts/release-smoke.ps1 -Binary target/release/modn.exe
```
