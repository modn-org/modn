# Releasing

The `Release` workflow publishes only when a maintainer pushes a `v*` tag. The tag
must equal the `modn-cli` version, for example `v0.2.0`. The workflow builds
`modn.exe` on Windows and smoke-tests it on a second, clean runner. The smoke
test runs from an empty directory, with no repository and no `cargo` or `rustc`
on `PATH`. It checks the checksum, the absence of C runtime DLL imports,
`search`, `install --dry-run` for a catalog mod and for a local archive, and
`doctor` on a fake game. It also checks that the fake game's files and their
contents are unchanged. The smoke test installs the pinned `buckets/main`
submodule, packed with that repository's `pack.py`. Only
then does the workflow publish the GitHub release with `modn.exe`, its checksum
and `install.ps1`. Bucket releases come from `modn-org/main`. A version with a pre-release
suffix, such as `0.2.0-alpha.1`, becomes a GitHub pre-release. Pull requests
that change the workflow or the smoke script run the build and smoke jobs, but
they never publish.

Run the same smoke test locally on a built executable:

```powershell
$env:RUSTFLAGS = '-C target-feature=+crt-static'
cargo build --release --locked -p modn-cli
$hash = (Get-FileHash target/release/modn.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
[IO.File]::WriteAllText("$PWD/target/release/modn.exe.sha256", "$hash *modn.exe`n")
python buckets/main/.github/scripts/pack.py buckets/main target/smoke/main-bucket.zip
pwsh -File .github/scripts/release-smoke.ps1 -Binary target/release/modn.exe `
  -Checksum target/release/modn.exe.sha256 -MainBucket target/smoke/main-bucket.zip
```
